<h3>Mark Completed Tasks:</h3>
Once you've completed a task, simply click the checkbox next to the task to mark it as completed. The task will be visually distinguished to show its completion status.

<h3>Delete Tasks:</h3>
If you no longer need a task, you can remove it from the list by clicking the "Delete" button next to the task.
