TODO

A todo manager that you didn't ask for, but needed !
to make sure that you complete your tasks on time ;)

react Vite 

Welcome to the React Vite Todo App! This is a simple web application built using React and Vite that allows users to manage their tasks. You can create new tasks, mark tasks as completed, and delete tasks. The app utilizes local storage to persist task data, ensuring that your tasks remain even after you close the browser.

Features

Create New Tasks:
Add new tasks to your to-do list by typing in the task description and pressing the "Add" button.

Mark Completed Tasks:
Once you've completed a task, simply click the checkbox next to the task to mark it as completed. The task will be visually distinguished to show its completion status.

Delete Tasks:
If you no longer need a task, you can remove it from the list by clicking the "Delete" button next to the task.

Local Storage:
The app uses local storage to store your tasks. This means that even if you close the browser or refresh the page, your tasks will be saved and available the next time you visit the app.
